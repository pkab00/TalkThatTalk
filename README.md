TalkThatTalk is a simple Russian-Korean phrasebook app. I actually created it to have some fun while learning Java, databases and git/github.

Stack: JDK 21.0.4, Swing, SQLite3, Maven.

The executable file is already built using Launch4j. All you need is to unzip the archive and run TalkThatTalk.exe
